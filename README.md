# SP_DragDropExtended
Adds additional drag and drop functionality to SharePoint 2013.

Currently requires some hard coded legwork for all functionality.

The relative paths to the document library need to be added into DragDropExtended.js

A datasheet view will need to be created with the view name "datasheet".
